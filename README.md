# Implementations of Classic nd Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm in C 

This repo contains two implementations of Reinforcement Learning algorithms:

- **Classic RL** - that builds a simple grid world environment and learns to avoid the bad states by utilizing a q-matrix that accumulates the agent's experience. The implementation code is written in C and resides within the directory named 'classic_rl'
- **Deep RL** - a simple crawling robot that learns to move forward by leveraging a deep reinforcement learning mechanism. It is based on OpenAI gym library. The implementation code, within the directory 'deep_rl' is written in python and utilizes pygame and pymunk to render the environment.
